# Firebase Todo List
This is just a practice todo list using React. <br><br>
The front-end is using the React framework and Axios for the CRUD operations.<br>

# Run It Yourself
If you'd like to try and run this React Todo List for yourself you'll need to download this repository and run 'npm start' from the client folder and also run the same 'npm start' from the server folder. You will also need some localhost server dev tool like XAMPP to emulate a MySQL database.
